# Setup Guide for Supervisor

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the Device Location Management System.

## 🎯 System Requirements

### Required Software
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js installation
- **Web Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (latest version)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository ([Download here](https://git-scm.com/))

### System Specifications
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: At least 500MB free space
- **Internet**: Required for initial setup and map tiles

## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Clone and Navigate
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DestinOzcan/Location.git
cd Location
```

### Step 2: Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Server running on port 3001
API available at http://localhost:3001/api
```

### Step 3: Frontend Setup (New Terminal)
```bash
cd location-website
npm install
npm start
```
**Expected Output:**
```
Local:            http://localhost:3002
On Your Network:  http://192.168.x.x:3002
```

### Step 4: Verify Installation
1. Open http://localhost:3002 in your browser
2. You should see the Device Management Dashboard
3. Navigate to different pages to confirm functionality

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### Backend Verification
- [ ] Backend server starts without errors
- [ ] Visit http://localhost:3001/api/devices shows device data
- [ ] No error messages in terminal

### Frontend Verification  
- [ ] Frontend loads at http://localhost:3002
- [ ] Map displays with device markers
- [ ] Navigation works between all pages
- [ ] Device registration form functions
- [ ] No console errors in browser developer tools

### Full System Test
- [ ] Register a new device through the interface
- [ ] Verify new device appears on map
- [ ] Check device appears in device list
- [ ] Confirm statistics update properly

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "npm command not found"
**Solution**: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### Issue: Port 3001 or 3002 already in use
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Kill processes on ports
npx kill-port 3001
npx kill-port 3002
```

### Issue: Dependencies installation fails
**Solution**:
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue: Map doesn't load
**Solution**: Check internet connection - map requires online access for tiles

### Issue: No devices showing
**Solution**: Ensure backend is running and check `backend/devices.json` exists
